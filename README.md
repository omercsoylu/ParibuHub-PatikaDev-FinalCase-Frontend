Firstly, BusinessToken ERC20 and BusinessCard ERC721 Contract must be deploy to any EVM-based blockchain network.
Then the "contract addresses" should be replaced with the variables in Contracts.js
The ABIs of each contract should be replaced with ​​in Abi.js

The BusinessWorld contract is deployed with the addresses of the BusinessToken and BusinessCard contracts.
In the same way, contract address and ABI of BusinessWorld should be replaced with in Contracts.js and Abi.js.

In order for the BusinessWorld contract to access the BusinessToken, 
the BusinessWorld contract address must be added as the owner with the "addOwner" function of the BusinessToken contract.

## FAQ

#### Can you give information about ERC20Token supply and mint?

The token supply is unlimited and the mint function only be controlled by the Game's contract.

#### What benefit do nft's features offer?

NFTs are each owned by employees with a title. The salary coefficients of these titles are different in the game. in this way, each NFT provides a different income.

#### What is the game time format?

-This is not valid for now. There is no time limit

 1 hour in real time means 1 day in game. an employee must work for at least one month, that is, 30 days. which is equivalent to 30 hours in real time. you stake one nft, so if you start the employee you cannot unstake for 30 hours.
  
#### How does the contract calculate revenue?

This game is a demo so we have defined a title for each id for convenience. For example, ids like 1-11-21 are CEOs. And the title of CEO has a revenue coefficient. Companies also have a revenue multiplier. In which company the NFT is employed, a salary calculation is made from these values ​​and the owner of the NFT can withdraw it in certain periods.
